Student Mark program

Write an assembly program (using 8086 MASM language) to calculate class work grades for each student in a class and the average grade in the class. Each student has three marks for three tasks. The total grade for a student equals the summation of the maximum two grades.
The program must achieve the following specs:
1- The number of students in the class is specified by the user.
2- Each task has marks in the range of [0, 5] (integer values only).
3- The total grade of a student is in the range of [0, 10] (integer values only).
4- Use emu8086 software to write, assemble, and emulate your code.
5- When you run your code:
a. Console window must be opened.
b. The text, “Please enter the number of students in the class: ”, is printed on the console window.
c. The user enters a number in the range of [1 – 30], followed by “Enter” press.
d. Any number outside the range is unacceptable. If happened, print the text “Please enter suitable number in the range of [1 - 30]: ”, then go to step c.
e. The number 0, if pressed, will cause the program to terminate.
f. The text, “Marks of student number (”, followed by student number, followed by “)” and a new line, is then printed on the console window.
g. The user enters three numbers representing task marks, separated by “Enter” press.
h. Steps f and g are repeated until all student data is entered.
i. The text, “Total grade of student number (”, followed by student number, “)is: ”, student grade, and finally a new line, is printed on the console window a number of times equals the number of students.
j. The text, “The average grade in the class is: “, followed by the average grade, and a new line, is finally printed on the console window.
k. The program is finished, go to step b to repeat the operation for a new class.
6- Write comments in your code so that it could be understood.
Notes:
1- It is not allowed to use emulator “off the shelf” functions, write everything yourself.
